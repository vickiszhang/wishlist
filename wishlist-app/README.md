# Project Outline

The app that I will be creating is a budget/expense tracker. The main functionality will include keeping track of the 
total amount of money that is available to spend, keeping track of purchases, and the ability to budget for items that 
the user wishes to save up for. 

Some practical examples for these functionalities are:
- If a user wishes to keep track of their total paychecks, the user can input the sum of money into the app.
- If a user makes a purchase, the app will automatically subtract the amount of the purchase from the total balance.
A user can go "in debt" and get a negative balance if they have made too many purchases. 
- If a user wishes to save up for an item such as a TV, the app will be able to list desired items, and user can 
choose to allocate a sum of their total balance to the item, the amount will be deducted as if a purchase was made,
unless there are insufficient funds to save. The
user will not be able to purchase an item off of the wishlist unless they have sufficient amount in their balance. 

It is important that the **history** of all "deposits" and purchases are kept in the case that the user wants to undo any 
actions, such as deleting a purchase. This app can be used by anyone who wishes to save up for any items and wants to 
keep track of the amount of money they have available to spend. It will also be useful to keep track of any recent 
purchases they have made.
